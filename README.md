# Proof of 𝜑-calculus confluence.

Formalization of 𝜑-calculus.


## About
We aim to formalize 𝜑-calculus and its properties in Lean 4. We first focus on proving confluence of minimal version of a calculus, and then we plan to add features and obtain a proof for the extended version.


## Installation

If you use VScode, get [lean4 extension](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4). In VScode, make sure to open root folder of the project. Then run `lake build`.
